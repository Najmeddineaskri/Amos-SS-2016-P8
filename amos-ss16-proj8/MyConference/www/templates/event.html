    <p>As a user I need a event view including name, date, time, place, agenda of the event, 
      to get all important information of the event. As a SD I have to setup a backend
      (store data, manage users, store events),     install it on the server and store some fake events in it.
      As a SD i have to clean up the repository     (remove the proof of concept app, keep the docker files)
      to have no useless files on the app any longer. 
      As a SD team member I have to creat the stucture based on blanked app with an empty menu</a></ion-item>
